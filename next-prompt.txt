🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2):
Once you confirm this basic version works, we can:
Re-enable the useLocation hook for real-time updates
Add bus location tracking with Namita's coordinates

Add real-time bus markers on the map


the bus markers on the map should be clickable. for example if i have logged in from namita's laptop (for the time being), the student's live map, the admin's live map and the driver's live bus all parallely should show namita's laptop location (as bus location) on the interactive map. When the student from their own interactive map click on the bus marker(namita's laptop in this case), it should show the bus details like destination, seat availability, passenger count, max capacity, status, last updated. do this for all the bus markers on the map. if i log in from more computers as drivers this same functionality should work, such that one student will be able to see themselves and multiple buses on their map, as well the admin should be able to see all the buses on their map, and the bus driver will also be able to see their own and the other other buses in the map.


when i forward the port, the site does not work. as in th when i login with my email and password, it says login failed. also when i go to the lie tracker page, until unless i am setting the location manually, the tracker can't detect my actual location. on its onw and says location failed to load, please retry. but the exact same thing works on thee laptop flawlessly. what may be the issue here?
